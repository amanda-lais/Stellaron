# Stellaron 🌌

Currently capable of generating a graph of all 88 modern constellations.
Constellation data used comes from [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium). Used [Skyfield](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield) and [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx).

Forked from my uni group's graph teory project for additional development both for fun and acquiring a better understanding about graphs. Fueled by my love of space and stars. ...And just wanting a project to fiddle with from time to time, I suppose, so development isn't *very* active.

Name comes from a weeb game.
