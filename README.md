Currently capable of generating a graph for each of all 88 modern constellations.
Constellation data used comes from [Stellarium](https://github.com/Stellarium/stellarium). Making use of [Skyfield](https://github.com/skyfielders/python-skyfield) and [NetworkX](https://github.com/networkx/networkx).

Forked from my uni group's graph theory project for additional development both for fun and acquiring a better understanding about graphs. Fueled by my love of space and stars. ...And just wanting a project to fiddle with from time to time, I suppose, so development isn't *very* active.

Required:
* Skyfield, `pip install skyfield`
* Networkx, `pip install networkx`

## Screenshots 🌌

満天の星空にほら　
浮かべてみて明日のビジョン
そこで見える　そこで見えるなら
もっと飛べるよ
満開の笑顔ならほら　
歌ってみてこのトキメキ
そこで会える　そこで会えるから
だってきっと　世界は変わるから
